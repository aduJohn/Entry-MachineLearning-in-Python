# MachineLearning-in-Python

  In this repository I put my work on learning MachineLearning concepts.

  At the moment I have a better understanding on these concepts:

  Regression, -> REG_concept -> "REG_MachineLearningConcept.py" :
  
->SimpleLinearRegression;

->MultipleLinearRegression;

->PolinomyalRegression;

->SupportVectorRegression;

->DecisionTreeRegression;

->RandomForestRegression;
